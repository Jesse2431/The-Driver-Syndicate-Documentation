### Q:  I recently installed The Driver Syndicate game but I couldn't launch it properly, or it displayed an error message upon starting.

A:  Make sure you have downloaded and installed all the pre-requisite distributables, they're usually shipped with the latest update of the game.
    You can still find them in #drvsyn-downloads section on Driver Madness Discord.

### Q:  When I'm playing the game with a keyboard it sometimes doesn't respond, cuts off temporarily or simply makes my car go the opposite direction.

A:  You should not have any problem if you only have your keyboard plugged in to play.
    if you have a controller plugged in, make sure to set the deadzone properly in order to stop the issue from happening, or simply disconnect your controller altogether.

### Q:  I want to play with my controller but the way it works is weird in the game, it feels off and sometimes disconnects.

A:  The default controller settings of the game enable the controller to use both the D-Pad and the Joysticks from the start:
    Left stick controls the direction and Right stick the acceleration / deceleration.
	It happens that having those two controls at the same time make them overlap occasionally, make sure to keep only one setting active, either D-Pad or Joysticks to make sure the issue is no longer.

### Q:  I see all the roads are square-shaped, are curved roads going to happen?

A:  Unfortunately, chances are very low, the same goes for getting out of your car.

### Q:  I'd like to rebind my keys / controller, how can I do that?

A:  Just like most games, there is an 'Controls' sub-menu in the 'Settings' menu from the title screen.
    You can also access minor controller settings such as deadzone percentage during gameplay by going to 'Controller settings' on pause menu.

### Q:  I like the Syndicate City map but is there more to see?

A:  You can find dozens of Add-ons on the #drvsyn-major-mods and #drvsyn-minor-mods sections of the Driver Madness Discord, there is a vast array of Add-ons, ranging from cars, maps, textures, scripts, ...

____________________________

### Q:  How do I install Add-ons?

A:  Most of the time you will have a README.txt file packaged with the add-on itself, which should contain all instructions regarding installation. Be sure to read it entirely!
    Once your addon is installed in your /Addons folder, you have to enable it in the game, through 'Settings' > 'Addons'.

### Q:  I installed some cars but they don't have wheels / float in the air?

A:  You might have installed some cars that require Hallgarth's Wheels, you can download them here:
    https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mQ2U691jc9X4f3shva-nCYQNkxFZqsCg?usp=sharing
	Simply place the 'CommunityCars' folder inside your /Addons folder.

### Q:  The wheels are finally appearing! But the car doesn't have any sounds when driving?

A:  The car you want to drive might be using a custom engine sound, you can find the mod over here:

### Q:  My settings reset after quitting the game!

A:  Verify if the game is in a admin restricted folder (Like Program Files), if so; move it to a non-admin folder (Like Desktop or Documents)
